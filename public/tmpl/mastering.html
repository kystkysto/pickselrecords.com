			<h2>Mix-Down Tips from our studio:</h2>
			<h3>1.</h3>
			<p>Control your high frequencies during mixing. All the percussion and hi-hats based in the high range of frequencies tend to turn louder during mastering process. So if you have any doubts that your hats and cymbals are too loud in your mixdown, probably your mix will need some heavy high frequency  compression on the mastering stage, which may cause some unwanted artifacts to your material. To avoid this try to compare your hat's volume with the kick during final mixing: in typical dance mix hats should be no louder than your kick.</p>

		<h3>2.</h3>
		<p class="text">Control your sub. A lot of dance music producers use some sub-low synths for the main bass instrument, but unfortunately not all of them have sufficient monitoring to mix it correctly. To achieve best results try to listen your mixes on different acoustics with low frequencies down to at least 40hz presented. Bass should be mixed with kick on comparatively same level, using sidechain compression can add some pumpin effect and clarity to your low end. Remember that your tracks will be played on club acoustics where always much lows, so finding the right balance is a crucial point for a great mix.</p>

		<h3>3.</h3>
		<p class="text">Do not forget the mids. Human ears are mainly focused on frequencies from 500 to 2500 hz, so the details in this range are highly important while composing, arranging and mixing. Spectral analyzer on master bus during your work can be a helpful tool, just watch instruments based in this range to be as loud as your bass and hats.</p>

		<h3>4.</h3>
		<p class="text">For vinyl release do not use any stereo effects on bass. To suit the limitations of this media, mastering engineer cuts all the stereo information below 100hz. For best results use only mono sources on all the low-ranged instruments, or separate stereo fxs to parallel bus and cut all the low end below 100hz on it. Making this during mixing stage will avoid ruining your bass on mastering. Also keep in mind that vinyl media format doesn't support excessive highs, try to arrange and mix percussion and high-ranged synths softly.</p>

		<h3>5.</h3>
		<p class="text">Before exporting your mixdown for mastering ensure that all your master bus effects are bypassed and your highest peak level is -3db. Export your tracks in original sample rate, 24 bit WAVs.</p>
